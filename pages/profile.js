        <p className="mb-5">I studied programming in depth, it&apos;s been more than 3+ years. I studied in depth PHP and JavaScript, especially Laravel for Back end and React for Front End, from the fundamentals to something advanced. I also learned everything from how to write clean code to How to make tests with TDD. Currently in my project web development I develop with PHP and Laravel for the back end, then React, Next.js for the front end and Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap for the web styling.</p>
